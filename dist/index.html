          <h2>Rules</h2>
          <p>
            The objective of Battleship is to try and sink all of the opponent's
            ships before they sink all of yours. Players take turns firing shots
            to attempt to hit the enemy ships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both players can not see the fleet of the other, you have to guess
            where is the ideal position to shoot at!
          </p>
          <p>
            When a player hits a tile that holds a ship, they can replay until
            they miss a shot.
          </p>
          <p>First player to sink all the opponent's ships wins the game!</p>

            Before starting, you need to place all your ships on the board. To
            do that, you can:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Drag and drop</b> the ships on the board
              <i>(single click to rotate them)</i>
            </li>
            <li>
              Press
              <b>random</b>
              to place your ships randomly
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Once that is done, press <b>start</b> and try to defeat the AI!</p>
